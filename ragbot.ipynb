Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services  that  have  not  yet  been  recognized  as  revenue.  The  estimated  revenue  backlog  and  timing  of  revenue recognition  for  these  commitments  is  largely  driven  by  our  ability  to  deliver  in  accordance  with  relevant  contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\n",

      "\n",
      "Looking at the context provided, there are two main segments mentioned: Google Services and YouTube ads. There's no mention of \"Nature of Operations,\" so I can skip that for now since the focus is on company revenue.\n",

      "Starting with Google Services, their operating income in 2023 was $23.937 million, and in 2024 it increased to $30.856 million. That's a significant jump. The change from $23.937 to $30.856 is an increase of $6.919 million. To find the percentage growth, I can calculate ((30.856 - 23.937)/23.937) * 100, which would give me the percentage increase from Google Services in 2023 to 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, looking at YouTube ads, their revenue went up from $2.669 billion in 2023 to $3.4 billion in 2024. That's an increase of about $731 million or a percentage growth based on the original amount. However, since both segments are separate, I need to compare them individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure if \"Nature of Operations\" affects the revenue percentages beyond their own performance. The context doesn't mention any other factors that might have influenced these revenues separately. So, it's safer to focus solely on the provided data for Google Services and YouTube ads.\n",
